I implemented all features detailed in the brief.
For part 3 (CGCW03.java) I used the lecture slides for reference but did not copy any code directly.



For part 1:
	I implemented translation rotation and scaling, controllable by keypresses as described in the brief

For part 2:
	Created SCylinder.java as described in the brief
	My cylinder includes top and bottom faces even though they are not visible from the specified viewing angle
	The top and bottom faces use separate points to the walls to allow for accurate normals at the corners
	I have arranged a scene of a sphere and a cylinder with different material properties as detailed in the brief
	I did not set the colours to be identical to those in the brief. It was only stated that they should be different from eachother.
	
For part 3:
	I created SCube.java as described in the brief
	Each face on the cube uses its own 4 points to allow for accurate normals at edges and corners
	I wrote CGCW03.java as described in the brief.
	My CGCW03,java was partly based on CGCW01.java and CGCW02.java and the lecture notes (no code was directly copied from the lecture notes)
	I created Texture.vert and Texture.frag as described in the brief
	CGCW03.java loads in WelshDragon.jpg and applies it as a texture onto the cube model
	The orientations of the texture on each side match the image given in the brief
	I matched the lighting configuration and cube orientation with the image in the brief as closely as I could
